Subject line: Manipulation is abuse. The new guide from Chayn HQ

Dear X,

Chayn, an award-winning, open-source organization has built a crowdsourced guide to help people recognise, prevent and cope with manipulative relationships.

Manipulation, and controlling and coercive behaviour, is now a criminal offence in England and Scotland, under [The Serious Crime Act, 2015](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482528/Controlling_or_coercive_behaviour_-_statutory_guidance.pdf). Offenders will receive a maximum of five years imprisonment, a fine or both.

At Chayn, we defend the right of every person to live a life free from abuse.

[Statistics](http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/equality/vaw/) consistently show women and girls are disproportionately affected by crimes of domestic violence and abuse, versus men and boys. This is underpinned by a wider societal gender inequality. We want you to join us and help put a stop to this unjust patriarchy and protect victims of these crimes.

Please contact us @ChaynHQ (team@chayn.co) and we will send you the guides and all necessary information for you to share this important, and potentially life-saving information, with your audience.

### **Why we should care about psychological abuse** {#why-we-should-care-about-psychological-abuse}

Manipulation, and controlling and coercive behaviour, is now a criminal offence in England and Scotland under [The Serious Crime Act, 2015](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482528/Controlling_or_coercive_behaviour_-_statutory_guidance.pdf). Offenders will receive a maximum of five years imprisonment, a fine or both.

One person shares that their abuse began as a child:

_&lt;&lt; My earliest memory as a toddler is standing terrified in front of my abusers, not understanding the silent treatment that I was being forced to endure, standing all alone, as they continued to ignore my upset and bewilderment whilst not allowing me to move from one specific spot. Various new abuses were invented as the years went by, some involving physical violence, and prolonged throughout my teens into adulthood._

_The feeling it left one with was nothing short of psychological torture. It was designed to exert control over my every action, my every thought, with the ultimate aim to ensure that I would lose all sense of selfhood. This wasn’t just so that I would “tow the party line” as a young child, over the years it became increasingly clear that my conforming was only one aspect of what my abusers wanted from me. They were also looking for the complete denigration and stripping away of personality, trust in others and hope — the three things that rendered me an individual in my own right_

_The aftermath of which is long-lasting and deeply held flawed beliefs about my character, my feelings, wants and desires, and a deep and darkly consuming depression and panic that visits at the most inconvenient of life moments. &gt;&gt;_

Physical abuse gets a lot of press coverage and media attention, and with good reason. However psychological and emotional abuse is also an extremely aggressive breaking down and gutting of another person’s sense of identity and entitlement to be a part of the world.

The burden that this is placing on society is beyond financial. It indicates a secret, lesser reported and insidious type of crime, affecting people across all aspects of their lives, with deaths from suicide and depression increasing among young people between the ages of 18–54 years,[disproportionately affecting young](http://www.youngminds.org.uk/about/whats_the_problem/mental_health_statistics) [men](http://www.youngminds.org.uk/about/whats_the_problem/mental_health_statistics).

The ONS breakdown of the[March 2015 Crime Survey for England &amp; Wales (CWES)](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/crimeandjustice/compendium/focusonviolentcrimeandsexualoffences/yearendingmarch2015/chapter4intimatepersonalviolenceandpartnerabuse#heavily-victimised-groups-of-partner-abuse) highlights further frightening statistics:

*   10% of victims (those that report, we don’t know the countless who do not report this either because they do not realise what is happening to them or recognise the signs of a manipulative and controlling relationship)
*   51% of female victims reported non-physical effects of this abuse, including ‘mental or emotional problems’ and ‘stopped trusting people or difficulty in other relationships’

Further s[tatistics](http://www.cps.gov.uk/publications/equality/vaw/) consistently show women and girls are disproportionately affected by crimes of domestic violence and abuse. This is underpinned by a wider societal gender inequality.

Regardless of what may drive someone to be manipulative and exert controlling behaviours, you do not deserve to be subjected to, or continue to accept, this aggression

This post is intended to bring attention to psychological abuse and its awful effects, giving us more than enough reasons to care about the effect it does, and will continue to have, on society should it go unchecked and without open debate, education and discussion.

We can and must do more to help people recognise, prevent and manage manipulative relationships.

That is why we do the work that we do at[Chayn](http://chayn.co/). Leveraging technology to empower and support all self-identifying women, first and foremost, against violence and oppression so they can live happier and healthier lives.

_Every person has a right to live a life free from abuse_

At Chayn, we want you to join us and help put a stop to this unjust patriarchy and protect victims of these crimes.

**Stats:**

“In 2014/15, 92.4% of defendants in domestic abuse flagged cases were male. Where recorded, the proportion of female victims has remained steady at 84%, since 2010-11 (CPS Violence Against Women and Girls Crime Report 2014/15).”

“NSPCC figures suggest one in five teenage girls has been assaulted by a boyfriend”

“About 1.2 million in Britain experience it each year with two dying every week”

The UK government introduced the changes because it found that “only eight out of 43 [police] forces were responding well to the issue”

1.  “Intersectional emotional abuse - the need for greater focus and attention on underrepresented and overlooked victims and survivors of abuse”

STRUCTURE FOR BLOG ABOUT INTERSECTIONAL VULNERABILITIES:

**Some groups are more vulnerable to emotional abuse than others** - for a range of reasons, including physical vulnerabilities, isolation from support, or other [barriers to receiving the help they need to protect themselves](https://www.womensaid.org.uk/the-survivors-handbook/women-from-bme-communities/).

Although anyone could be a victim of manipulative behaviour, [84% of victims in the UK are women](https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/482528/Controlling_or_coercive_behaviour_-_statutory_guidance.pdf), and the individuals highlighted at being at particular risk include:

*   *   *   Minorities and marginalised groups
        *   Recent immigrants
        *   Elders who are facing abuse and manipulation from caregivers
        *   Parents in fear of losing children
        *   Individuals in forced marriages
        *   LGBTQ+
        *   Those who are physically disabled.

The reasons these groups face increased vulnerability vary hugely. Older individuals could be vulnerable if dependent on caregivers, particularly in care homes - [statistics from the USA suggest 1 in 10 older people is a victim of abuse each month, and a survey revealed 40% of care home workers admitted to psychologically abusing a patient](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs357/en/).

Other groups may be particularly at risk because they are less likely to be able to find help and support, again for varied reasons. The [CPS advises](http://www.cps.gov.uk/legal/d_to_g/domestic_abuse_guidelines_for_prosecutors/#a75) that some LGBTQ+ individuals may be isolated from family to seek support, may fear being ‘outed’ by seeking help, or may be at risk of manipulation by their own family because of their own sexuality (for example, being coerced into marriage).

It may also be difficult for other groups to seek help and support for abuse from many institutions. For example, parents of young children may also fear highlighting abuse to social services for fear of threats of their children being removed. Women’s Aid explains [here](https://www.womensaid.org.uk/the-survivors-handbook/women-from-bme-communities/) that a fear of institutional racism in the UK may prevent women from black and minority ethnic backgrounds from contacting such services, to avoid exposing partners, families or themselves to racist treatment.

This is by no means an exhaustive list of groups who are at risk or the reasons for being so, but it highlights the intersectional complexities of identifying and seeking protection from emotional abuse.

*   Some groups are more vulnerable to finding themselves in these manipulative relationships, including (but not limited to):
    *   Black and Minority Ethnic backgrounds
    *   Immigration Status
    *   Elder abuse and manipulation by carers
    *   Fear of losing children
    *   Forced marriage
    *   LGB&amp;T
    *   Physically disabled
        *   These factors affect the ability and willingness of these groups in particular, to recognise or report abusive behaviour. Perpetrators may try to exploit such situations in order to maintain control, or try to prevent the victim from seeking help

**Stats:**

Black and Minority Ethnic backgrounds:

“However, the form the abuse takes may vary; in some communities, for example, domestic abuse may be perpetrated by extended family members, or it may include forced marriage, or female genital mutilation (FGM).

Whatever their experiences, women from Black, Asian or minority ethnic communities are likely to face additional barriers to receiving the help that they need.”

From this WomensAid article: [https://www.womensaid.org.uk/the-survivors-handbook/women-from-bme-communities/](https://www.womensaid.org.uk/the-survivors-handbook/women-from-bme-communities/)

Elder abuse and manipulation by carers: Data on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are scarce. A survey of nursing-home staff in the United States of America, however, suggests rates may be high:

*   36% witnessed at least 1 incident of physical abuse of an elderly patient in the previous year;
*   10% committed at least 1 act of physical abuse towards an elderly patient;
*   40% admitted to psychologically abusing patients.

And: Around 1 in 10 older people experience abuse every month.

From this WHO article: [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs357/en/](http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs357/en/)

LGB&amp;T:

Useful detailed context on why LGB&amp;T individuals can be more vulnerable:

“For example, there may be some pre-existing isolation from the complainant&#039;s family as a result of the individual&#039;s sexual orientation or gender identity which may be exploited by an intimate partner.

Exploitation and abuse by the perpetrator could manifest in a variety of ways, as explored above through the use of physical or sexual violence, or through controlling or coercive behaviours. A complainant may fear their preferences or relationship choices may be &#039;outed&#039; by an intimate partner or there may be threats of removal of children by Social Services.

Additionally, where complainants&#039; families are aware of sexual orientation or gender identity, there may be coercive or controlling behaviours used by those family members to deny or hide an individual&#039;s sexual or gender identity, such as being forced into marriage, or even being physically abused. Some LGBT complainants may even be physically abused or forced into marriage by family in the belief that this may &#039;rectify&#039; their sexual orientation or gender identity”
