You feel you can express and act on your own opinions and views without fear of repercussions from the significant other in the relationship. | ...if you feel you are being used for the benefit of the other person in the relationship, at the cost of your emotional wellbeing. If you feel like this, you are most likely being manipulated, or in a manipulative situation. |

* A manipulative relationship is one-sided and unstable
* A mnipulative relationship is not limited to a romantic relationship. It is a relationship where you feel you are being emotionally abused or manipulated into actions and situations where you feel physical and / or emotional distress. Partners, family, carers, friends, colleagues and teachers could all be responsible.

* Manipulation intends to coerce you. It is the use of force or intimidation to obtain compliance
* Some countries are already including manipulation and coercive control into their laws. For instance, abusers who control their victims through social media accounts or spy on them online could now face up to five years in prison in the UK.

### Who this guide is for:

We are all susceptible to being manipulated in relationships. Men and women can be victims of manipulative relationships. However, statistics show that women and girls are disproportionately affected by crimes of domestic violence and abuse.

There are various socio-economic factors that affect the ability and willingness of some groups to recognise or report abusive behaviour. Perpetrators may try to exploit such situations in order to maintain control, or try to prevent their targets from seeking help.

Some groups are more vulnerable to finding themselves in these manipulative relationships, including \(but not limited to\):

* Minorities and marginalised groups
* Recent immigrants
* Elders who are facing abuse and manipulation from caregivers
* Parents in fear of losing children
* Individuals in forced marriages
* LGBTQ+
* Physically disabled

If you are in an abusive relationship with anyone, you deserve to get the help you need.
