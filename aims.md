You might be reading this guide because you feel like your rights, interests and safety are at stake. This also includes your emotional wellbeing and safety.

Ever felt like someone knew how to push your buttons, and despite how uncertain you were of believing or doing something, somehow they were able to make you believe or do something else? Ever felt like someone was trying to control you or force you into situations you do not wish to participate in?

You could be dealing with a manipulative person and have found yourself in a manipulative relationship.

This is not limited to behaviour in romantic relationships. You can be manipulated by partners, family, friends, carers, colleagues, teachers - any situation where you feel you are being emotionally abused or manipulated into actions and situations you do not want to be a part of.

This guide is not meant to be an exhaustive list, but rather a compilation of subtle, as well as more outright examples of manipulation and control, and how you can identify and remove yourself from these abusive situations.

Not everyone who acts in the following ways may be deliberately trying to manipulate you. Regardless, it’s important to recognize these behaviors in situations where your rights, interests and safety are at stake.

This is a list of things you can think about, to help you increase your safety.

**If you are still in the relationship:**

* Think about the different options available to you
* Keep important and emergency telephone numbers with you \(see the resources section below\)

**If you do decide to leave:**

* Try not to place yourself in a vulnerable position or isolate yourself
* Consider telling your employer or others at your place of work - particularly if you think your abuser may try to contact you there
* If you live with the person, spend time planning where would be a safe place for you to stay as soon as you leave

**If your abuser continues to \(try to\) manipulate and control you:**

* Keep detailed records of each incident, including the date and time it occurred, what was said or done, and, if possible and relevant, photographs of any damage or injury caused to yourself or others. Also see the [“How to build your own Domestic Violence case without a Lawyer” guide](http://chayn.co/how-to-build-your-own-case/).

These three scenarios have an emphasis on romantic relationships, but the principles behind all of them apply to any manipulative situation you may find yourself in, and need to remove yourself from.

Remember, manipulation and coercive control - that is the use of force or intimidation to obtain compliance - is illegal in England and Scotland. New powers will target perpetrators who subject spouses, partners and other family members to serious psychological and emotional torment but stop short of violence.
